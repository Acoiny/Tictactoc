# Tictactoc
A simple tictactoe clone, but with a little twist :D  

## The Twist
Each player only gets three pieces to place.
After all pieces have been placed, the first will be removed again.


## Requirements
To build Tictactoc you need a C++ compiler and the sfml libraries installed.
Also, a font placed at `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/DejaVuSans.ttf` wouldn't
hurt either ;)
